        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Pepperoni pizza is a classic Italian-American dish that features a 
           delicious combination of savory tomato sauce, melted mozzarella cheese,
           and slices of spicy pepperoni on a crispy pizza crust. It's a favorite 
           choice for pizza lovers around the world and is known for its bold and
           satisfying flavors.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>16 ounces pizza dough, store-bought or homemade</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce (see below)</li>
            <li>18 to 20 slices pepperoni</li>
            <li>12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fresh oregano, optional</li>
            <li>Flour for rolling and shaping dough</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 500Â°F. If you are using a pizza stone, preheat
                it in the oven for at least 20 minutes so it is nice and hot as
                well.
            </li>
            <li>Make the sauce:
                If you are using my sauce recipe, stir together the ingredients.
                The sauce recipe makes just enough for one large pizza. You can
                easily double it if you are making more than one pizza.
            </li>
            <li>Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface. If it's hard to roll,
                let it rest for 5 minutes so it can come to room temperature. For
                a large pizza, I like to roll my dough into about a 14-inch diameter 
                circle.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly dusted pizza peel. Alternatively,
                fit it into a large cast-iron.
            </li>
            <li>If you're using a pizza stone, carefully slide pizza into the center
                of the preheated pizza stone. Cook for 6 minutes, then rotate the pizza 
                halfway so it cooks evenly. Cook for another 6-8 minutes, or until the
                crust is golden brown and charred in spots.
            </li>
            <li>Use pizza peel to slide pizza out onto a cutting board. Let the 
                pizza rest for a minute and slice into pieces. Season with fresh
                oregano (optional). Serve while warm with a side salad.
            </li>
            <li>Stir together the softened butter and honey, then serve alongside
                the pizza for crust dipping.
            </li>
        </ol>
