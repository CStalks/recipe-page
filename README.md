# Recipe Page
This project is a simple recipe page created using HTML and CSS. In this project,
I focused on structuring elements such as ordered list(ol), unordered list(ul), 
paragraphs(p) and more while adding styles to enhance the appearance of the webpages.

## Key Learning Points
* HTML Structure: I gained hands on experience in structuring web content using HTML,
  utilizing elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and more to organize present information effectively.

* CSS Styling: I also practiced applying CSS styles to enhance the appearance of the
  webpage and worked on colors and typography to create an appealing user interface.
